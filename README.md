# Natural-Language-Inferencing-For-15-Languages

1.   Introduction</br>
Natural language processing (NLP) has grown increasingly elaborate over the past few years. Machine learning models tackle question answering, text extraction, sentence generation, and many other complex tasks. But, can machines determine the relationships between sentences, or is that still left to humans? If NLP can be applied between sentences, this could have profound implications for fact-checking, identifying fake news, analyzing text, and much more.</br>
If you have two sentences, there are three ways they could be related: one could entail the other, one could contradict the other, or they could be unrelated. Natural Language Inferencing (NLI) is a popular NLP problem that involves determining how pairs of sentences (consisting of a premise and a hypothesis) are related.
The main task is to create an NLI model that assigns labels of 0, 1, or 2 (corresponding to entailment, neutral, and contradiction) to pairs of premises and hypotheses.</br></br>
2.   Goal</br>
The main goal of this project is to determine the relationship between different sentences by classifying the relation between the sentences according to their respective labels and train the model to obtain good accuracy. The assigned labels are  0, 1, or 2 (corresponding to entailment, neutral, and contradiction) respectively.</br></br>
